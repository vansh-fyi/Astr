# Retrospective: Epic 1 - Foundation & Core Data Engine

**Date:** 2025-11-29
**Participants:** Alice (PO), Charlie (Senior Dev), Dana (QA), Bob (SM), Vansh (Project Lead)

## Epic Summary
*   **Goal:** Establish the app shell, navigation, and the "Brain" (Astronomy Engine).
*   **Status:** Completed
*   **Delivery:** 3/3 Stories (100%)
*   **Velocity:** 11 Story Points
*   **Quality:** 100% Pass Rate on Tests

## Key Wins
*   **Architecture:** Successfully established a Clean Architecture foundation with Riverpod and GoRouter.
*   **Offline Capability:** Integrated `sweph` (Swiss Ephemeris) for offline astronomy calculations, meeting a critical NFR.
*   **Robustness:** Implemented `fpdart` for functional error handling, ensuring no crashes in the location service.
*   **Theme:** "Deep Cosmos" theme implemented from day one.

## Challenges & Lessons Learned
*   **Visibility:** Backend-heavy epics (like this one) can feel "invisible" to stakeholders.
    *   *Lesson:* Prioritize visual widgets earlier in future epics to demonstrate progress.
*   **Technical Risk:** `swisseph` relies on FFI, which is hard to test in CI/VM environments.
    *   *Lesson:* Manual verification on physical devices is critical for FFI-based features.

## Action Items
1.  **[Critical] Physical Device Verification:** Verify `swisseph` engine on a real Android/iOS device. (Owner: Vansh/Charlie)
2.  **[Process] Visual Priority:** In Epic 2, prioritize UI stories (Bortle Bars) to improve visibility.

## Next Steps
*   **Proceed to Epic 2: The Dashboard**
*   Focus on delivering the "Good/Bad" summary and visual indicators.
